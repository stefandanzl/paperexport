Chen, L. (2019). Limitations of Markdown for academic writing: A critical analysis. *Journal of Digital Academic Publishing*, 8(2), 145-163.

## Summary
This paper critically examines the limitations of plain Markdown when used for academic writing purposes, highlighting the gaps that need to be addressed by extensions or companion tools.

## Key Points
- Plain Markdown lacks sophisticated citation management capabilities
- Complex formatting requirements in academic publishing cannot be easily met with Markdown alone
- Tables and figures are particularly challenging to implement elegantly in Markdown
- Conversion workflows from Markdown to publication formats often require additional processing steps

## Quotes
"Plain Markdown lacks some features essential for academic writing, such as sophisticated citation management and complex formatting options."

"While Markdown excels at simplicity, this very quality becomes a limitation when confronting the complexity demanded by academic publishers."

## Notes
The paper includes a survey of 120 academic authors who had attempted to use Markdown for scholarly writing. The findings indicate that most continued to use Markdown for drafting but switched to other tools for final preparation of manuscripts.
