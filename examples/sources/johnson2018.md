Johnson, K. (2018). The impact of markup languages on writing processes: A comparative study of LaTeX, HTML, and Markdown. *Journal of Writing Research*, 10(1), 67-84.

## Summary
This study examines how different markup languages affect the writing process, with particular attention to the cognitive load they impose and their effect on writing flow.

## Key Points
- Researchers who used Markdown reported spending less time on formatting and more time on content development
- LaTeX users exhibited the highest levels of formatting-related interruptions
- Writers using WYSIWYG word processors showed more attention to visual formatting during initial drafting
- Markdown represented a middle ground that balanced structural clarity with minimal syntax intrusion

## Quotes
"The cognitive load associated with complex markup syntax directly impacts the fluidity of the writing process."

"Participants using Markdown consistently reported greater satisfaction with their ability to maintain focus on content rather than syntax."

## Notes
The study involved 35 participants with varying levels of technical background, each asked to complete identical writing tasks using different markup languages. Performance was measured through task completion time, error rates, and qualitative feedback.
