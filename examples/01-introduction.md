# Introduction

Academic writing is a critical component of scholarly work. It allows researchers to communicate their findings, arguments, and insights to the broader academic community. However, the process of writing academic papers can be challenging, especially when it comes to formatting and organizing the final document.

This paper discusses the development of PaperExport, an Obsidian plugin designed to streamline the process of academic writing by allowing authors to write in Markdown and export to professional-looking PDFs.

## Background

Markdown has gained popularity as a lightweight markup language that allows writers to focus on content rather than formatting. Its simplicity and readability make it an attractive option for academic writing. However, academic papers often require specific formatting that can be difficult to achieve with basic Markdown.

Additionally, many researchers prefer to work on different sections of their papers separately, which can make it challenging to maintain a cohesive document. This is where PaperExport comes in.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this paper is to:

1. Introduce the PaperExport plugin for Obsidian
2. Explain its key features and functionality
3. Demonstrate its effectiveness in streamlining the academic writing workflow
4. Discuss potential future developments

The scope of this paper is limited to the technical aspects of the PaperExport plugin and its applications in academic writing. It does not cover the broader topics of academic writing guidelines or best practices.

## Research Questions

This paper aims to address the following research questions:

1. How can Markdown be effectively used for academic writing?
2. What features are essential for converting Markdown documents to professional academic papers?
3. How can a plugin streamline the workflow for researchers writing academic papers?

By addressing these questions, this paper contributes to the ongoing discussion about digital tools for academic writing and their impact on scholarly productivity.
