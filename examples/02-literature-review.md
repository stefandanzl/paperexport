# Literature Review

## Academic Writing Tools

The landscape of academic writing tools has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Traditional word processors like Microsoft Word have been the standard for many years, offering a familiar interface and comprehensive formatting options. However, these tools often prioritize appearance over content, which can distract writers from the substance of their work.

LaTeX has emerged as a powerful alternative, particularly in STEM fields, due to its superior handling of mathematical equations and bibliographies. However, LaTeX has a steep learning curve and requires writers to work with code-like syntax, which can be intimidating for many.

Markdown represents a middle ground between these approaches. As noted by [[smith2020]], "Markdown provides a balance between simplicity and functionality that makes it particularly suitable for academic writing."

## Markdown in Academic Contexts

Several studies have explored the use of Markdown in academic contexts. [[johnson2018]] found that researchers who used Markdown reported spending less time on formatting and more time on content development. Similarly, Wong and Garcia (2021) observed that students who wrote papers in Markdown showed improved focus on argumentation and evidence.

However, as pointed out by [[chen2019]], "Plain Markdown lacks some features essential for academic writing, such as sophisticated citation management and complex formatting options." This limitation has led to the development of various extensions and tools designed to enhance Markdown for academic purposes.

## Note-taking and Knowledge Management

The relationship between note-taking, knowledge management, and academic writing is another relevant area of research. Obsidian, as a knowledge management tool, builds on the concept of linked notes to create a network of ideas. This approach aligns with the non-linear nature of research and thinking, as argued by Thompson (2022): "Effective academic writing emerges from the connections between ideas rather than from a strictly linear process."

## Gaps in Existing Research

While there is growing interest in Markdown-based academic writing, few studies have examined the integration of Markdown into comprehensive academic workflows. Additionally, there is limited research on how plugins and extensions can enhance the functionality of Markdown for specific academic purposes.

This paper aims to address this gap by presenting PaperExport as a case study of how Markdown can be extended to meet the specific needs of academic writers without sacrificing the simplicity that makes Markdown attractive.

## Theoretical Framework

This research is grounded in the theory of cognitive load, which suggests that learning and productivity are optimized when cognitive resources are directed toward relevant tasks rather than extraneous processes (Sweller, 1988). Applied to academic writing, this theory suggests that tools that minimize the cognitive load associated with formatting and organization allow writers to focus more on content and argumentation.

PaperExport, by simplifying the process of formatting and organizing academic papers, aims to reduce extraneous cognitive load and thereby enhance the writing process.
